The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/verilog_boy_v1_0_0/inst/verilog_boy_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/top/boy/high_ram_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/verilog_boy_v1_0_0/inst/verilog_boy_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/top/boy/high_ram_reg/WEA[1] (net: design_1_i/verilog_boy_v1_0_0/inst/verilog_boy_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/top/boy/dma_n_48) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/verilog_boy_v1_0_0/inst/verilog_boy_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/top/boy/cpu/a_reg[1]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
